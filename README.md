# SequentialContainers
The purpose of this project is to enhance c++ skills by implementing all the sequential containers as template classes

I do not know how extensive these classes will be but my main objective is to get some experience writing classes, constructos, templates etc. My aim is to try and mimic common functionality, but not get into complex things such as different allocator support.
