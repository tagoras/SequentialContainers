# SequentialContainers
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my understanding of core c++ programming language (OOP, Constructors, Templates etc.) by providing a high
level implementation of vector class from c++ standard library.

---
All the essential code is contained inside of the Vector.h file
The use of raw pointers in this project is intentional and is only for learning purposes.
